Fancy Inc is a multinational brewing company based in Europe that offers a variety of flagship products, including Fancy Cider, Fancy Beer, and Fancy Stout. One of the significant markets for this organization is in Mexico, and proper planning is essential. However, there have been frequent issues of out of stock in this market lately, which is why the business is looking for a balanced forecast for all products and stores. This forecast will help avoid piling up inventory and out of stock situations, which have become even more pressing due to the rising costs of raw materials.

As a data scientist, your task is to create an accurate forecast for all products and stores. To achieve this, you are provided with data on sales, including the date, store city, product name, and the quantity marketed. Based on this data, you should provide your forecasts in hectolitres, and if necessary, add safety stocks to ensure that inventory levels remain stable.
